# Support Channels

To better assist with your issue:

  * Include your username on the cluster.
  * What machine are you trying to use, e.g. login or development node?
  * On emails, please use 'Reply All' in all your correspondence.
  * Don't include screenshot images; cut-and-paste text from the console.
  * If you have problems with jobs (e.g. not running or given errors), make sure to include the job IDs of the job you need help on.
  * Never include PHI or other sensitive data in unencrypted emails or slack channels. If you need to include sensitive data, use the UCSF encrypted email system (invoke by including "Secure:" at the start of the email subject line.) Do not include sensitive data in your slack posts.
