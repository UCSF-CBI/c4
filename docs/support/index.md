For questions and feature requests, please use one of the following channels:

1. **Mailing list [tipcc@listsrv.ucsf.edu](https://listsrv.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=tipcc)** [sic!] - A communal forum where you can ask for help and discuss problems and solutions (you need to subscribe before you can post messages)

   - Subscribe / unsubscribe: (a) go to [list homepage](https://listsrv.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=tipcc), (b) click 'Subscribe or Unsubscribe', (c) enter your full name and preferred email address, and (d) click link in confirmation email that arrives within minutes.
   - Web archives: N/A <!-- [list homepage](https://listsrv.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=tipcc) (only visible to subscribed list members). -->

2. **Github Issue Tracker [c4-help](https://github.com/UCSF-CBI/c4-help/issues)** - A communal forum for {{ site.cluster.name }} users to post questions and issues. This tracker is visible to all C4 users and the Sysadmin team. This is the very best way to get help.

<!--  - Join: (a) go to [signup page](https://join.slack.com/t/ucsf-wynton/signup), and (b) enter your UCSF(\*) email address. (\*) If you don't have an email address that ends with ucsf.edu, or it for other reasons does not work, [let us know]({{ '/about/contact.html' | relative_url }}) and we will send you an invite to your preferred email address. -->

These are communal forums - feel free to ask questions, answer questions, and participate in discussions.

If you have requests that you rather prefer to address directly to the system administrators, please don't hesitate dropping us an email.

3. **{{ site.cluster.name }} System Administrators and Managers email list**

    - [{{ site.cluster.email_admin }}](mailto:{{ site.cluster.email_admin }}) - reaches all systems administrators and managers.
