# Open OnDemand

Open OnDemand is a web based framework with easy to use GUI interfaces for common cluster tasks. It's other major use is for enabling interactive software such as RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks via the same easy to use GUI interfaces.
Open OnDemand was developed at the Ohio Supercomputer Center. We have integrated this framework into C4. The primary use case for us was enabling easy to use RStudio and Jupyter based on user input.

## How to use OnDemand

1. As with the rest of C4, you must be on Campus or connected via UCSF IT VPN to use.

2. From your workstation, connect to OnDemand at: <a href="https://c4-ondemand1.ucsf.edu">OnDemand</a>

3. Enter your C4 username and password. Click the Login button.

## C4 OnDemand Overview

Open OnDemand is a very good open source project out of the Ohio Supercomputer Center. The mission of Open OnDemand is to provide and intuitive easy to use approach for interactive work on an HPC cluster like C4. We are hoping it will make C4 more approachable for new HPC users and for those wanting to do interactive work on powerful compute resources. The current list of interactive applications are RStudio, Jupyter, and the C4 interactive desktop which is an easy way to run graphical applications without the need for ssh tunnels.
