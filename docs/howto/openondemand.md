# Open OnDemand

Open OnDemand is a web based framework with easy to use GUI interfaces for common cluster taks. It's other major use is for enabling interactive software such as RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks via the same easy to use GUI interfaces.
Open OnDemand was developed at the Ohio Supercomputing Center. We have integrated this framework into C4. The primary use case for us was enabling easy to use RStudio and Jupyter based on user input.
