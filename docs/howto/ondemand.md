# {{ site.cluster.name }} OnDemand

[Open OnDemand] is a web-based framework with easy to use GUI interfaces for common cluster tasks. It is a well supported open-source project developed at the Ohio Supercomputer Center. We have integrated OnDemand with {{ site.cluster.name }} to provide an easy to use interface for interactive jobs. In addition to a file browser capable of moving files on and off the cluster, and a web-based {{ site.cluster.name }} terminal, we support interactive applications including:

* Linux Desktop - a MATE GUI desktop for Linux in your web browser
* RStudio Server - run R via the RStudio interface
* Jupyter Notebooks - in beta test mode (as of May 2022)

These are all available via your local web browser with full access to the {{ site.cluster.name }} compute resources.

## How to use OnDemand

1. As with the rest of {{ site.cluster.name }}, you must be on the campus network, or connected via the UCSF VPN

2. From the web browser on your local workstation, connect to one of our OnDemand servers:
    1. <https://c4-ondemand1.ucsf.edu>
    2. <https://c4-ondemand2.ucsf.edu>

3. Enter your {{ site.cluster.name }} username and password, and click 'Login'

After completing these steps, you have full access to the {{ site.cluster.name }} OnDemand website and its tools and applications.
