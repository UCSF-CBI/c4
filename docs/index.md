STATUS UPDATE (August 26, 2017): The goal is for Wynton go live in the next few weeks.  Initially, Wynton will operate in a beta stage where early adopters will help us identify remaining issues, bugs, and common user needs that have been overseen by the Wynton Technical Working Group.  As such initial problems are resolved, we will roll out access to more users and groups.  If you are interested in early access to Wynton, you may already now <a href="{{ '/about/join.html' | relative_url }}">reach out to us</a>.

# Wynton - UCSF Research Computing at Scale

Wynton is a large, shared high-performace compute (HPC) cluster underlying UCSFâ€™s Research Computing Capability. Funded and administered cooperatively by UCSF campus IT and key research groups, it is available to all UCSF researchers, and consists of different profiles suited to various biomedical and health science computing needs.  Researchers can participate using the "co-op" model of resource contribution and sharing.

In the initial phase (Fall 2017), our focus is to accommodate existing users from the earliest contributing UCSF centers (Memory & Aging, Inst. for Computational Health Sciences, Dept. of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, and QB3).  In addition, **we encourage research groups who want to join the cooperative environment through new purchases or equipment migration to [contact us] for planning and evaluation**.  We plan to bring on more UCSF centers every few months.  Finally, once we achieve sufficient size and robustness, **we will also offer additional guest accounts for UCSF researchers who are not contributing to the co-op model**, to help meet the computational needs of the broad range of UCSF faculty and staff.  We plan to complete the wide rollout within 12 months.

If you don't fit one of the above early-access categories, but are really keen to participate in one way or the other, please don't hesitate to [contact us] - we'd love to hear from you.
