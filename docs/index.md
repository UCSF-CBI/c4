STATUS UPDATE (August 26, 2017): The goal is for Wynton go live in the next few weeks.  Initially, Wynton will operate in a beta stage where early adopters will help us identify remaining issues, bugs, and common user needs that have been overseen by the Wynton Technical Working Group.  As such initial problems are resolved, we will roll out access to more users and groups.  If you are interested in early access to Wynton, you may already now <a href="{{ '/about/join.html' | relative_url }}">reach out to us</a>.

# Wynton - UCSF Research Computing at Scale

Wynton is a large, shared computing cluster underlying UCSFâ€™s Research Computing Capability. Funded and administered cooperatively by UCSF campus IT and key research groups, it is available without costs to all UCSF researchers, and consists of different profiles suited to various biomedical and health science computing needs.  Priority access is granted to those who contribute resources. Non-contributing users may use CPU cores when these cores would otherwise be idle. Contributing users are granted shares of the cluster, proportionate to the contribution, that translate into priority access to the computing power.
