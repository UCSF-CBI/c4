#### <span style="color: orange;">Partial shutdown</span>

**Notice**: On Wednesday August 1 at 6:45am, parts of the compute nodes (msg-io{1-10} + msg-*gpu) will be powered down. They will be brought back online within 1-2 hours.  The reason is a planned power shutdown affecting one of Wynton's server rooms.

## Past Incidents

### June 16-26, 2018

#### <span style="color: orange;">Power outage</span>

**Resolved**: The NVidia-driver issue occurring on some of the GPU compute nodes has been fixed.
<br><span class="timestamp">Jun 26, 11:55 PDT</span>

**Update**: Some of the compute nodes with GPUs are still down due to issues with the NVidia drivers.
<br><span class="timestamp">Jun 19, 13:50 PDT</span>

**Update**: The login nodes and and the development nodes are functional. Some compute nodes that went down are back up, but not all.
<br><span class="timestamp">Jun 18, 10:45 PDT</span>

**Investigating**: The UCSF Mission Bay Campus experienced a power outage on Saturday June 16 causing parts of Wynton to go down.  One of the login nodes (wynlog1), the development node (qb3-dev1), and parts of the compute nodes are currently non-functional.
