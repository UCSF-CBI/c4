#### <span style="color: orange;">Network and BeeGFS upgrades (full downtime)</span>

**Notice**: Starting early Monday December 7, the cluster will be powered down
entirely for maintenance and upgrades, which includes upgrading the network
and the BeeGFS file system.  We anticipate that the cluster will be available
again by the end of Tuesday December 8, when  load testing of the upgraded
BeeGFS file system will start.  If these tests fail, we will have to unroll
the BeeGFS upgrade, which in case we anticipate that the cluster is back
online by the end of Wednesday December 9.
