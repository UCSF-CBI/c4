### December 7-10, 2020

#### <span style="color: orange;">Network upgrades (full downtime)</span>

**Update**: The upgrade is paused and will resume tomorrow.  We hope to be bring all of the cluster back online by the end of tomorrow.  For now, login node 'log2' (but not 'log1'), and data-transfer nodes 'dt1', and 'dt2' are back online and can be used for accessing files.  The scheduler remains down so it will not be possible to submit jobs at time stage.

**Update**: The upgrades have started.  Access to Wynton HPC has been disable as of 10:30 this morning.  The schedulers stopped launching queued jobs as of 23:30 last night.

**Revised notice**: We have decided to hold back on upgrading BeeGFS during
the downtime and only focus on the remain parts including network upgrades.
The scope of the work is still non-trivial.  There is a risk that the
downtime will extend into Thursday December 10.  However, if everything go
smoothly, we hope that Wynton HPC will be back up by the end of Monday or
during the Tuesday.  There will only be one continuous downtime, that is,
when the cluster comes back up, it will stay up.

**Notice**: Starting early Monday December 7, the cluster will be powered down
entirely for maintenance and upgrades, which includes upgrading the network
and the BeeGFS file system.  We anticipate that the cluster will be available
again by the end of Tuesday December 8, when  load testing of the upgraded
BeeGFS file system will start.  If these tests fail, we will have to unroll
the BeeGFS upgrade, which in case we anticipate that the cluster is back
online by the end of Wednesday December 9.
