#### <span style="color: orange;">Rebooting compute nodes</span>

**Notice**: The new BeeGFS setting introduced during the upgrades earlier this week caused problems throughout the system and we need to roll them back.  The compute nodes will no longer take on new jobs until they have been rebooted. A compute node will be automatically rebooted as soon as all of its running jobs have completed.  Unfortunately, we have to kill jobs that run on compute nodes that are stalled and suffer from the BeeGFS issues.

#### <span style="color: orange;">Limited accessibility of Login node log1</span>

**Notice**: Login node 'log1.wynton.ucsf.edu' is only accessible from within UCSF network. This is a side effect of the recent network upgrades. We are waiting for The UCSF IT Network to resolve this for us.  Until resolved, please use the alternative 'log2.wynton.ucsf.edu' login node when connecting from outside of the UCSF network.
