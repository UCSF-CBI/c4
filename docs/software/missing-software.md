# Missing Software?

Is the software you need not installed on the cluster?  If so, you have a few options:

1. Install it yourself to your own account

   - Download a pre-built binary
   - Build software from source (traditional)
   - Build software from source (using Spack)


2. Use Singularity to run it via a Linux container

   - Pull down an existing image from Singularity Hub
   - Download and bootstrap and existing Singularity image
   - Set up your own Singularity image


3. Reach out to the Wynton user community

   - It could be that someone else has already installed it,
     is interested in also installing it, or is willing to help


4. Core software

   - If it is a core software, it may be that the [the system administrators](/about/contact.mtml) are willing to add it to the core installation.
