SBGrid is a [collection of hundred of programs](https://sbgrid.org/software/) for structural biology. It is kept up to date by the [SBGrid] team without needing intervention by the {{ site.cluster.nickname }} admins. Each lab using SBGrid must pay a yearly fee. This covers usage by anyone in the lab, both on {{ site.cluster.name }} and any other Linux or Mac computer they own. The annual price depends on how many other labs from UCSF join. There are approximately 12 UCSF labs currently enrolled. See <https://sbgrid.org/join/> for information on how to join.

## Verify access to SBGrid

The SBGrid software stack is installed on {{ site.cluster.name }} but is available only to paying members of the [SBGrid Consortium](https://sbgrid.org/join/).  {{ site.cluster.name }} users who are [SBGrid members] are part of the `sbgrid` Unix group on the {{ site.cluster.name }} cluster.  You can verify this by running:

<!-- code-block #1 -->
```sh
[alice@{{ site.devel.name }} ~]$ groups
lsd sbgrid
```

If `sbgrid` is not part of your output, then you do _not_ have access to the SBGrid software on {{ site.cluster.name }}.  If you think this is a mistake, please [contact us].


## Enable SBGrid

In order to use SBGrid software, the SBGrid environment must be enabled.  To enable the SBGrid, in the shell or in a job script, do:

<!-- code-block #2 -->
```sh
[alice@{{ site.devel.name }} ~]$ source /programs/sbgrid.shrc
