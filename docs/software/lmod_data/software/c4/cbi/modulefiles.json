To fix this, this module adds `-Djava.io.tmpdir=$TMPDIR` to `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS` making Java to also use that.  Without this, Java uses the tiny local `\/tmp` folder for temporary files with the result that `\/tmp` quickly fills up, especially on multi-user machines, causing processes to fail and the machine to become unusable.

This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations. PROJ includes command line applications for easy conversion of coordinates from text files or directly from user input. In addition to the command line utilities PROJ also exposes an application programming interface, or API in short. The API lets developers use the functionality of PROJ in their own software without having to implement similar functionality themselves.\nExamples: `geod`, `proj` and `man proj`.\n","url":"https:\/\/proj.org\/, https:\/\/proj.org\/news.html (changelog), https:\/\/github.com\/OSGeo\/PROJ (source code)","defaultVersionName":"8.2.1","package":"proj"},{"description":"ASCIIGenome is a genome browser based on command line interface and designed for running from console terminals.
