# Join the Cluster

We will only be provisioning C4 accounts upon request, we will not migrate all TIPCC accounts in order to clean up old accounts that are no longer relevant.  If you have not requested a C4 account, please email the sysadmin.  Please include your TIPCC username and your GitHub username in the request email.  See the [Roadmap] for more details.
