# Join the Cluster

Any UCSF Cancer Center members and members of their labs can join the {{ site.cluster.name }} cluster.  To get an account, please send an email to the [sysadmin] using your UCSF email address with the following information of yours:

1. First and last name
2. Preferred username (lower case) - if you already have a TIPCC account, please use that
3. Name of your HDFCCC lab or supervisor
4. GitHub username (used for our issue tracker - to join, go to <https://github.com/join>)

To existing TIPCC users: We will only provision C4 accounts upon request. We do this in order to identify and clean out TIPCC accounts on longer in use.
