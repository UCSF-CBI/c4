# Join the Cluster

{{ site.cluster.name }} is a large, shared high-performance compute (HPC) cluster underlying UCSF's Research Computing Capability. Funded and administered cooperatively by UCSF campus IT and key research groups, it is available to all UCSF researchers, and consists of different profiles suited to various biomedical and health science computing needs. Researchers can participate using the “co-op” model of resource contribution and sharing.


## Co-op model

The end goal is that the all UCSF researchers should have access to the cluster without charge.  Free accounts will be limited by the number of concurrent cores and will have lower priority on the job queue.  Participating co-op members that contribute to the cluster will get priority on the job queue and will be able to utilize a large number of concurrent cores (proportionate to the contribution).


## Who can join?

The {{ site.cluster.name }} HPC environment is available for _free_ to all UCSF researchers, which includes faculty and principal investigators (PIs) as well as research staff, students, and postdocs affiliated with a faculty or a PI.  If you don't fit into one of these categories, please don't hesitate to [contact us].
