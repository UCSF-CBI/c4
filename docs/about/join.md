# Join the Cluster

The C4 cluster is going live on January 4 2020. We will only be provisioning C4 accounts upon request, we will not migrate all TIPCC accounts in order to clean up old accounts that are no longer relevant. If you have not requested one. please email the sysadmin (Harry Putnam). Please include your TIPCC userid and your github id in the request email/  See the [Roadmap] for more details.
