# Shared Cluster Computing at UCSF

**Purpose.**
C4 was built to support the research programs of HDFCCC members.  In the process, researchers benefit from maximized
economies of scale in building, administering, and using the cluster. The cluster provides computing capacity, network connectivity internally at UCSF and externally to research networks such
as the Pacific Research Platform, data storage, job queueing with accounting,
and systems administration. As a result, the cluster contributes directly to the
basic mission of the HDFCCC, including research, education, and outreach.

**Governance.**
The cluster is governed by the CBI Shared Resource, more specifically, by its director, Adam Olshen.  Henrik Bengtsson, Harry Putnam and Adam Olshen, all from the CBI, together make decisions related to its operations.  Harry Putnam is the system administrator for the system.  Henrik Bengtsson leads on software decisions related to the cluster.  The CBI welcomes input on how to make C4 better.
