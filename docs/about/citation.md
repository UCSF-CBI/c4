## Grant Applications

Below is example on how to give details on the Wynton HPC environment in a grant application:

> Wynton HPC is a distributed high-performance computing cluster with nodes
> in many different data centers on the UCSF campus.  All Wynton sites are
> connected by multiple 40 Gbps network connections.  Wynton currently
> contains 90 nodes with over 1,800 CPU cores.  RAM in the nodes ranges from
> 48 to 768 GB with an average RAM-to-core ratio of over 10 GB.  There are
> also 16 nodes containing a total of 58 GPUs(*).  Storage is provided by a
> parallel filesystem providing 400 TB of mirrored home space and 500 TB of
> global scratch space.
> 
> Wynton is shared by many research groups at UCSF.  Load balancing on the
> cluster is achieved through SGE (originally Sun Grid Engine). The
> computing power of the cluster guaranteed to any given research group is
> directly proportional to the funds that the group contributed to the
> cluster. The balance of the computing power not used by the contributors
> is available to other registered groups (including other contributors) on
> a first-come, first-served basis.
>
> (*) At the moment, GPUs are only available to the groups who contributed
>     them.  It is on the roadmap to add communal GPU nodes as well.
