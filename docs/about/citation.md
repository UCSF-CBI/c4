## Grant Applications

Below are a few examples on how to give details on the {{ site.cluster.name }} environment in a grant application.  _The node and CPU cores counts are updated on a regular basis._

### Example 1

> {{ site.cluster.name }} is a distributed high-performance computing cluster with nodes
> in Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center data center on the UCSF campus.
> {{ site.cluster.name }} currently contains 10 nodes with over 384 CPU cores.
> RAM in the nodes ranges from 512 to 768 GiB with 
> an average RAM-to-core ratio of over 15 GiB.
> Storage is provided by a combination of NFS and parallel filesystems 
> providing home space and 200 TB of global scratch space. $HOME directories
> are backed up to tape nightly.
>
> {{ site.cluster.name }} is shared by Cancer Center members at UCSF.  Load balancing on the
> cluster is achieved through Slurm. All users are welcome to use the common
> partition for running jobs. Resources from the common partition are assigned
> on a first come first served basis. A number of Labs own "Condo" compute nodes
> which are assigned to dedicated partitions for those labs. In addition to global
> scratch many labs also own their own NFS storage nodes for their own use.


### Example 2

> {{ site.cluster.name }} is a computational research cluster shared by Cancer Center members at
> UCSF.  The cluster is run as a combination co-op and Condo farm. Any user
> is free to use the common partition made up of communal compute nodes.
> Labs may also purchase private Condo nodes strictly for their own use.  
> The cluster currently consists of 10 nodes with 384 cores.
> Each node has at least 512 GiB of RAM and total home storage is 200 TiB.
